Representing the resplendent and majestic Italian Renaissance style of architecture, beautifully blended with Indian influences, Victoria Memorial Hall stands today, as a veritable icon of the city of Kolkata. VMH was envisaged by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of British India, as a memorial to the deceased Queen Victoria. According to Curzon, this memorial was to take the form of a great marble hall, to be erected on the Kolkata maidan to serve primarily as a monument to the Queen and secondarily as a national gallery and Valhalla of the Indian Empire. The mission of the Victoria Memorial Hall is to function as the premier art gallery, museum, research library on art history and museum studies, and cultural space in the city of Kolkata. To pursue this mission, it collects, conserves and disseminates knowledge among the general public about art objects, historical relics, and documents relating mainly to Indian history in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In addition to the exhibits on permanent display, the Victoria Memorial Hall also organizes regular special exhibitions, lectures, publications, cultural programmes and interactive educational activities throughout the year for the benefit of audiences, especially the youth.",

Nawab Mir Yousuf Ali Khan, popularly known as Salar Jung III was appointed prime minister by Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Nizam VII in 1912. Salar Jung III relinquished the post of dewan or Prime Minister in November 1914 and devoted his life in enriching his treasures of art and literature. The news of his passionate love for art had spread far and wide and his ancestral palace, the Dewan Deodi was forever thronged with sellers of wares from all corners of the world. He also had agents abroad who sent him catalogues and lists from well-known antique dealers. He did not limit his purchases only to these sources but also made purchases personally during his tours abroad to Europe and the Middle Eastern countries. Not only was he a great collector of antiques, art and rare manuscripts he also patronized poets, writers and artists, encouraging literary and cultural activities. He was responsible for the publication of many books on his own family members. This went on for forty years till he passed away on 2nd March 1949., the entire collection was left behind without an inheritor. It was the family members of the late Nawab who got together to gift the fabulous collection to the nation as there could not have been a better proposal.",
